# Copy Symlink itself to change pyjom's location, install easyd services for macos local pyjom watchdog

```bash
cd /media/root/parrot
cp -R -P /media/root/help1/pyjom .
```

because of the qqChatBot task, pyjom on kali may be syncing too often. need to check the watchdog logs.

turned out it is the `__pycache__` dirs to be blamed

disable all sync related services on macos for debug:

main issue happens after local vscode launched.

the issue is such that the proxy setting not right.

to debug the service:

```bash
sudo launchctl debug gui/501/pyjom_local_syncdog --stdout --stderr
```

```bash
# to be succint:
launchctl list | grep syncdog | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -I abc kill -s TERM abc

# instead of:
#launchctl list | grep pyjom_local_syncdog # to get process pid
#kill -s TERM <service_pid>
```
we need to add some code for it. consider adding something alike to that to kali?

```python
os.environ["http_proxy"]="http://localhost:7930"
os.environ["https_proxy"]="http://localhost:7930"

```

```bash
launchctl stop gui/501/pyjom_local_watchdog;
launchctl kill TERM gui/501/pyjom_local_watchdog;
launchctl unload gui/501/pyjom_local_watchdog;
launchctl disable gui/501/pyjom_local_watchdog;
launchctl remove gui/501/pyjom_local_watchdog;

launchctl stop gui/501/pyjom_local_syncdog;
launchctl kill TERM gui/501/pyjom_local_syncdog;
launchctl unload gui/501/pyjom_local_syncdog;
launchctl disable gui/501/pyjom_local_syncdog;
launchctl remove gui/501/pyjom_local_syncdog

```

install macos pyjom watchdog (local):

```bash
easyd -l pyjom_local_watchdog -w /Users/jamesbrown/Desktop/works/sync_git_repos -- /usr/bin/python3 /Users/jamesbrown/Desktop/works/sync_git_repos/watchdog_macos.py
```

install macos pyjom syncdog (local):

```bash
easyd -l pyjom_local_syncdog -w /Users/jamesbrown/Desktop/works/sync_git_repos -- /usr/bin/python3 /Users/jamesbrown/Desktop/works/sync_git_repos/syncdog_macos.py
