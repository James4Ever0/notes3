# Pyatspi dogtail gnome accessibility gui inspect tool for linux a11y

bookmark_history_search sucks. it does not include webpage summaries, only title, which makes searching the history very hard. the solution is to use readbility.js to visit and summarize these pages, and update these documents in meilisearch.

a11y is the general term for accessibility, for web browsers like firefox. however, there's implementation for gnome internally.
