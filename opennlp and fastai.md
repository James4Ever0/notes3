# opennlp and fastai

## [opennlp](https://opennlp.apache.org/)

opennlp uses onnx runtime(maybe?), may support m1 inference.

opennlp is written in java. after installing openjdk on macos with homebrew, run this to ensure openjdk is detected:

```bash
 sudo ln -sfn $(brew --prefix)/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk
```

## [fastai]
