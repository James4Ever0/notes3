# Deeplearning on MacOS M-series Processors

## tensorflow with m1 support

## pytorch with m1 support

## run python inside swift

use [pythonkit](https://github.com/pvieito/PythonKit.git)

## automatic machine learning using CreateML

```swift
import CreateML
```

CreateML is similar to any other [AutoML]() tools, like [AutoKeras](https://autokeras.com/), 

## using CoreML

CoreML models can be created by CreateML and some customization can be done.

[onnxruntime]() can run onnx models on CoreML.
