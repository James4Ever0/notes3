# Remove Unused pip dependencies

sometimes we install a single package which brings about tons of dependencies in python, `pip-autoremove` comes in handy.

install it by `pip3 install pip-autoremove`

though be careful these dependencies might not be used in other existing packages, they are sometimes still being used in your code!
