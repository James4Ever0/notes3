# random giphy gifs

## gif ratings

[official doc](https://support.giphy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058840971-Content-Rating)

vulgar rate:

r > pg-13 > pg > g

while 'y' means accepting all shits, not 'youth' nor 'young'

## implementation

giphy has many extensible apis. i guess most media platforms are all the same (complex enough), but we have to start somewhere though...

giphy has 'clips' now. clips are gifs with sound, just like short videos.

beta key limitations:

1000 requests per day, 42 requests per hour

~~or just use the public beta key? does that subject to the rate limit?~~

this public beta key is trashed.

```javascript
var PUBLIC_BETA_API_KEY = 'dc6zaTOxFJmzC';
```

api keys:
