# the kali command on macos

would it be interesting to run all our kali connectors ranged from vscode-ssh-connect, rclone mount and direct ssh connection via `kali` command dynamically by our kali discovery service, if we can reload the nginx daemon on demand.

should we use p2p networks to speed up remote connections?

using redis to store some daemon reported values.

first value is `online`.

next value is `kali_ip`.

using both value to determine whether to connect to kali or not, and the exact address.
