# the kali command on macos

would it be interesting to run all our kali connectors ranged from vscode-ssh-connect, rclone mount and direct ssh connection via `kali` command dynamically by our kali discovery service.

using redis to store some daemon reported values.

first value is `online`.

next value is `kali_ip`.

using both value to determine whether to connect to kali or not, and the exact address.
