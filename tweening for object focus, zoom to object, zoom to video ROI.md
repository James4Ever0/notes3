# tweening for object focus, zoom to object, zoom to video ROI

focus on person only, crop video and leave only human region untouched:
https://github.com/ConceptCodes/portal-zoomer

focus/zoom on given object using [pytweening, a easing/tweening function collection](https://pypi.org/project/pytweening/).

or just use ffmpeg.

does vidpy/mltframework and some other libs supports that? requires investigation.
