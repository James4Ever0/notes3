## dog/cat video generation
### make render engine runnable
issues:
- [ ] video length too long (10 mins)
- [ ] bgm somehow not in sync (too broad bpm/clip ranges?)
- [ ] to analyze the peaks (abrupt changes) in bgm and grab louder peaks using `pyloudnorm` (getting audio volume)
```bash
pip3 install pyloudnorm
```
- [ ] place video on loudest points, abrupt changes detected by talib or just take direvative and gaussian average
- [ ] video too repetitive (small corpus?)
- [ ] do not remove subtitle and crop active region (reviewer's resource not used? but i rather advise you to do it directly since it requires less computational power)
- [ ] do not have minimum motion threshold (reviewer's fault? also recommend you to do this in producer)
