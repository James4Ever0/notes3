# scan this picture and index the whole video/document/ppt/textbook!

## non-max suppression in combining similar bounding boxes

the lib:
```python
from imutils.object_detection import non_max_suppression
```

## basically greek letters

maybe you can document another great range of symbols by just enabling the system to search in greek?

could also search among math symbols, do [math ocr](https://github.com/chungkwong/MathOCR).

## kindly reminders

when building python c++ libraries without xcode, please add commandline header files like this:

in order to have this during build:
```/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.8/Headers/Python.h```

we need to do:
```bash
ln -s /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

## search by image instead of cranking latex out

### image search libraries

character level optical char segmentation called [chargrid ocr](https://github.com/akkshita/chargrid-ocr)

[image match used for copyright violation detection, using phash algorithm](https://github.com/ProvenanceLabs/image-match)

## get the latex out

### first detect the location of math formula

[dataset for math symbol detection](https://github.com/MaliParag/TFD-ICDAR2019)

### next find the tool for picture to latex conversion

## mask latex area and get conventional things out

[easyocr with pytorch support](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR)

## search the formula

[formula search based on sympy](https://github.com/AzizAlqasem/FormulaLab)

can we render latex to picture with sympy?
