# Bookmark Browsing Directory Tree Browsing History Collection

Using Kali forensic tool. (turned out not needed. just some googling for answers)

Organized under modifier termux ~/works/bookmark_dirtree_traverse. search via rg.
maybe we can organize directory trees using other methods, like some javascript library with both a search tool and a browsing tool. we can host a search engine via javascript, only static resources and client side computation.

this client side search engine usage example can be found at /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/shared/works/milkshake_server and ./external/milkshake_server. the js searching library is called fuse.js.

I have made this into meilisearch, and i have backed it up to github/james4ever0/notes2 and aliyunpan and baiduyunpan. desktop search experience is better. meilisearch consume too much ram. i consider to find alternatives with less ram consumption.
