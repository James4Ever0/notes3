# gitter developer tokens

to get the token, login first, then visit [here](https://developer.gitter.im/apps) or click "sign in" [here](https://developer.gitter.im/)

it seems the login issue of opqbot is related to the account itself, not gitter token or proxy

by the way we could always use go-cqhttp, without the ability to collect red packet and add group/friends.

qq add group/friends may be enabled by our windows virtual machines. without opq, it is very memory intensive.
