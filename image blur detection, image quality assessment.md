# image blur detection, image quality assessment

## blur detection, detect blur/nonblur area, score the image

### traditional methods

[score and output mask for blurry areas](https://github.com/WillBrennan/BlurDetection2) using laplacian

[using fourier transform](https://github.com/whdcumt/BlurDetection)

[This project](https://github.com/Utkarsh-Deshmukh/Spatially-Varying-Blur-Detection-python) outputs regions in an image which are sharp and blurry. In order to perform "OUT-OF-FOCUS" blur estimation, please refer to [this repo](https://github.com/Utkarsh-Deshmukh/Blurry-Image-Detector)

### deeplearning blur image classification/scoring
