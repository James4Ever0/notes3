# Automatic CMCC network switching

the policy follows:

kali, could you use some network card for sniffing while connecting to existing network? or could you automate the sniffing so that we don't get bored?

for macos and linux:

if modifier hotspot is present, connect to it.

otherwise if CMCC present, connect to it.

if CMCC fails after login attempts, try to connect with some paid network.

for modifier:

if CMCC present, connect to it.

if CMCC fails, try to connect with some paid network.
