# Automatic CMCC network switching

the policy follows:

如何校园网免流？

kali, could you use some network card for sniffing while connecting to existing network? or could you automate the sniffing so that we don't get bored?

could you extract some login default patterns?

for macos and linux:

if modifier hotspot is present, connect to it.

otherwise if CMCC present, connect to it.

if CMCC fails after login attempts, try to connect with some paid network.

for modifier:

if CMCC present, connect to it.

if CMCC fails, try to connect with some paid network.
